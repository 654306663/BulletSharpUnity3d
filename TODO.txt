Implement:

GhostPairObject to implement callbacks

Manifolds have a maximum of 4 points can use lifetime to find first contact 

SoftBody should inherit from BCollisionObject

Constraints warning if constraining to static geometry

Constraints warning if both rigid bodies are the same

Add a BCollisionShape field to the RigidBody so shapes can be shared across rigid bodies. Perhaps shapes should be scriptable objects instead of
Monobehaviors since they don't actually use their transform. A RigidBody will use a shape if component is present else it will look for an 
attached collision shape component.

Implement editors for the collision shapes and add warnings explaining which shapes support local scaling and which shapes are for static
vs. dynamic geometry. Add checks in the code for this.

Implement localScaling for the shapes that support it.

---- BCollisionCallback
Find out if we can just use a reference to the ManifoldPoint, when does the ManifoldPoint get disposed. Am I responsible for that or is Bullet?

Improve the use of HashSets so we are not allocating two new HashSets every LateUpdate

Find out if there can be multiple collision manifolds between the same pairs of CollisionObjects. If so we need to change the callback algorithm.

---- All components

Everything should be properties so that changes can be intercepted and passed on to the corresponding Bullet objects

---- BPhysicsWorld

Integrate layers to control what can collide with what.
Make the World configurable so it is possible to change the Brodphase algorithm, Collision Dispatcher algorithm etc...

---- Create a trigger equivalent component

---- Implement the Constraints

---- Native Plugin builds for more platforms, OSX, Windows Store, Android, iOS etc...

---- Unit tests and examples. Don't bother with examples until we are very happy with the components

---- BulletSharp Demos, finish implementing these.
        MeshFactory2.CreateShape is wrong for Cylinder. It is creating a cube. Needs to be a Cylinder.

---- Loads to do
